        - `max_discharging_power_ratio`: Maximum discharging power as a fraction of storage capacity per hour (unitless, 0–1)
        - `charging_efficiency`: Fraction of energy retained during charging (unitless, 0–1)
        - `discharging_efficiency`: Fraction of energy retained during discharging (unitless, 0–1)

**Note:** All ratios are relative to the respective appliance's maximum capacity or power. Units are indicated in parentheses.
    

- **Usage Preferences (`usage_preference.json`)**  
    Specifies user-defined preferences and constraints for energy usage and appliance operation. Example structure:
    - `consumer_id`: Unique identifier for the consumer
    - `_preferences`: containing
        - **Grid preferences**: Preferences for grid interaction (e.g., "prefer self-consumption", "allow export up to X kWh")
        - **DER preferences**: Preferences for usage of distributed energy resources (e.g., "curtailment cost", "limit wind export", "green consumption ratio")
        - **Load preferences**: Preferences for consumption (daily/hourly) and flexibility:
            - `load_id`: Unique load identifier
            - `min_total_energy_per_day_hour_equivalent`: Minimum daily energy usage (kWh or equivalent hours)
            - `max_total_energy_per_day_hour_equivalent`: Maximum daily energy usage (kWh or equivalent hours)
            - `hourly_profile_ratio`: Desired hourly usage pattern (array of ratios)
        - **Storages**: Preferences for usage of energy storage:
            - `storage_id`: Unique storage identifier
            - `initial_soc_ratio`: Initial state of charge (0–1)
            - `final_soc_ratio`: Desired final state of charge (0–1)
        - **Heat pumps**: Preferences for heat pump operation (e.g., "min runtime", "preferred hours")

- **DER Production (`DER_production.json`)**  
    Contains time series data for DER output profiles at each consumer location.
    - `consumer_id`: Location where the DER is evaluated
    - `DER_type`: Type of DER (e.g., "PV", "wind")
    - `hourly_profile_ratio`: Array of normalized hourly production values (0–1)

- **Bus Data (`bus_params.json`)**  
    Defines technical and economic parameters for each network bus.
    - `bus_id`: Unique bus identifier
    - `import_tariff`: Tariff for net energy import (DKK/kWh)
    - `export_tariff`: Tariff for net energy export (DKK/kWh)
    - `max_import_kw`: Maximum allowed import power (kW)

**Note:**  
These files allow customization of user behavior, DER production, and network constraints for simulation and optimization. Students can extend or replace these datasets as needed to conduct adequate simulations and sensitivity analysis. We recommend that any new or modified files follow the same structure for compatibility with the starter code, and easy grading. Please document all new datasets in this README.md file.
